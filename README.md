## ✨ Welcome ✨
</br>

This Next.js project is a work in progress. 

I'm exploring React.js, Next.js, and other libraries for the first time. The code is not the cleanest yet because I'm experiementing and throwing code quickly together. 

I'll be working on this project in-between and after applying for new career opportunities.
